## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

The service-metrics SDK allows service authors to integrate with
[Loggregator](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/architecture.html),
the Cloud Foundry logging and metrics system, using a colocatable BOSH release.

## <a id="architecture"></a> How Do Service Metrics Work?
![service-catalog-workflow](img/service_metrics_workflow.png)

Service metrics are colocated with the service job.
The service job runs as a daemon process and executes a metrics generation command at regular intervals.
The service author generally provides a binary for that purpose.
In this case, the metrics generation command invokes the binary.

Service metrics receives the output of the metrics generation command and performs validation on the [format](author.html#output).

If validation succeeds, Service-backups sends the metrics to the Metron agent deployed on the VM.
Metron forwards metrics to Doppler.
You can configure Doppler to forward the metrics to a third-party app such as Papertrail
or to the Loggregator Traffic Controller.
